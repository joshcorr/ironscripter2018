Greetings Iron Scripters. The march to Iron Scripter continues. Obtaining, manipulating and presenting data is an important skill to master as you’ll learn in this challenge.
You’ll also need to do some research to solve the puzzle.
Your task is to create a reusable PowerShell artefact that will access the PowerShell.org feed - https://powershell.org/feed.
For each entry in the feed the following information must be displayed:

• Title
• Publication date
• Link
• Author

The data should be displayed in a manner that the allows the user to select a post from the feed.
The selected post should then be opened in a browser OR the text of the post should be downloaded and displayed to the user.
The user should be able to decide on browser or console display.
Use best practice if it doesn’t conflict with your faction’s aims.

The solution must be acceptable to your faction:
• Daybreak Faction - beautiful code
• Flawless Faction - flawless code
• Battle Faction - good enough to get the job done

For a bonus can you make the code work for any feed?
As in previous challenges the standard is PowerShell v5.1. Will the code work on PowerShell v6?
Good luck and good coding.
