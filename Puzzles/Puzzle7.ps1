Greetings Iron Scripters. The countdown to Iron Scripter continues.
The ultimate contest will soon be upon you.
In this weeks challenge you’re required to create a PowerShell class.
The class should have the following properties:
    • Computer Name
    • BIOS manufacturer and version
    • Domain of which the machine is a member – you’ll need to decide how to handle non-domain machines
    • Number of processors and number of cores
    • Total physical memory in GB
    • Operating System name
    • Operating System Architecture
    • Time zone
    • Size of C: drive (GB)
    • C: drive free space (GB)

The class should have default constructor and a constructor that accepts a Computer name and domain as parameters.
Methods should be created to populate the remaining properties.
You should also create a method that will calculate the percentage free space on the C: drive.
Is it possible to create the class so that it will automatically populate ALL properties of the class when an instance of the class is instantiated on a machine?

Use best practice if it doesn’t conflict with your faction’s aims.
The solution must be acceptable to your faction:
• Daybreak Faction - beautiful code
• Flawless Faction - flawless code
• Battle Faction - good enough to get the job done
Good luck and good coding.
