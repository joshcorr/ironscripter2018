Greetings Iron Scripters. When you complete this challenge, you’ll be over a quarter of the way to Iron Scripter.
There are many command line tools still in use that don’t have PowerShell equivalents.
For this challenge you are required to generate a PowerShell equivalent to the output of netstat.exe.
The code should output objects that can be used for sorting and filtering.
You should then do the same for the arp.exe utility. Again, the expected output is objects that can be used on the PowerShell pipeline.
The functionality should be delivered as a module that can be easily distributed.

Use best practice if it doesn’t conflict with your faction’s aims.

The solution must be acceptable to your faction:
• Daybreak Faction - beautiful code
• Flawless Faction - flawless code
• Battle Faction - good enough to get the job done
As in previous challenges the standard is PowerShell v5.1. Will the code work on PowerShell v6?
Good luck and good coding.
