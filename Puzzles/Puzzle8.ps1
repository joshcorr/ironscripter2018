Greetings Iron Scripters. The countdown to Iron Scripter continues with only a few weeks left before the main event.
In this weeks challenge you’re required to:
    • Create a user on the local machine – named Bill Bennsson
    • Create a second user on the local machine – named Andy Pandien
    • Create a folder in the root of the C:\ drive. Folder name is SpecialFolder
    • Create a file in the folder named SpecialFile.txt
    • User Bill Bennsson should be able to read and write the contents of the file – including change the contents
    • User Andy Pandien should be able only read the file
    • NO other users should be able to access the file

All of the above tasks should be performed in a script or function that can be used on multiple machines if required.

Use best practice if it doesn’t conflict with your faction’s aims.
The solution must be acceptable to your faction:
• Daybreak Faction - beautiful code
• Flawless Faction - flawless code
• Battle Faction - good enough to get the job done
Good luck and good coding.
