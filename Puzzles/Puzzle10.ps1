Greetings Iron Scripters. This is your last challenge before Iron Scripter.

• List all event logs that contain 1 or more records
• Determine the percentage of the log size that has been used
• If the log is over 80% full: o Ensure that the log is set to over write old records as required.  o Increase the maximum log size by 10%
• Create a log file of your changes
• Your code should not display any errors when run.
• Your code should display all logs that have entries in them.
• Your code should display any hidden logs that contain entries in them.
• You should display the complete log name, and the number of entries in the log.
• The number of entries in the logs should be displayed in descending order (the log with the most entries in it should appear on the first line of the output).

The solution must be acceptable to your faction:
• Daybreak Faction - beautiful code
• Flawless Faction - flawless code
• Battle Faction - good enough to get the job done
Good luck and good coding.
